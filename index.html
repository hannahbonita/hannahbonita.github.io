    <p>I'm a senior at Eastern Washington University who is majoring in technical communication and minoring in visual communication design. Originally from Walla Walla, WA, I currently reside in Cheney, WA. Once I graduate from EWU in the summer of 2014, I hope to find a job working for a nonprofit organization, (particularly a grassroots environmental conservation organization like Sierra Club or Rainforest Action Network). EWU is the fourth college I have attended since graduating from high school in 2003. Since I have attended numerous schools, my areas of focus have respectively changed. I have an extensive background in interior design and formal English composition, so I decided to pursue technical communication at EWU to couple design with English composition.</p>

    <h2>Additional Interests</h2><p>My interests outside of school include hiking, camping, canoeing, tattoos, going to concerts, reading, traveling, gardening and spending time with my family and our cat.</p>
